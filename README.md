## Genetic explorer for budgerigars
Back in 2006 I had a website with a Java applet that showed a budgerigar and by switching radiobuttons one could experiment with different genetic mutations and their affect on the outlook of the bird.
Java applets long time not supported so it's time to implement a same tool in Javascript.
